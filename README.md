# üöÄ CryptoStake | Decentralized Price Prediction DApp

CryptoStake is a decentralized price prediction platform built on Ethereum, allowing users to bet on whether the price of a crypto asset (e.g., ETH/USD) will increase or decrease relative to a starting point. The platform uses Chainlink Oracles for secure, reliable, and decentralized price data.

## ‚ú® Features

### Smart Contract Logic

* **Chainlink Integration:** Uses the **Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface** (specifically the Sepolia ETH/USD Price Feed) to set the initial bet price and determine the final outcome.

* **Pool Lifecycle Management:** The contract owner can explicitly start (`startPool`) and end (`endPool`) the betting cycle.

* **Shared Payout Model:** Funds staked by losers are proportionally distributed among the winners.

* **Minimum Stake:** Enforces a minimum bet equivalent to \$5 USD at the time of transaction.

* **Re-staking:** Players can increase their stake in the current pool.

### Frontend Application

* **Wallet Integration:** Seamless connection using **Wagmi** hooks.

* **USD Conversion:** Automatically converts the user's dollar input into the required ETH value using the real-time Chainlink price feed for staking.

* **Responsive UI:** Dark-themed, intuitive interface built with **Tailwind CSS**.

* **Admin Dashboard:** Dedicated interface for the contract owner to manage the betting pool lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Blockchain / Smart Contract

* **Solidity:** Smart contract language.

* **Chainlink:** Price Oracle for decentralized data feed.

* **EVM (Sepolia Testnet):** Deployment environment (as indicated by the Chainlink address).

* **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Utilizes `EnumerableSet` for efficient player tracking.

### Frontend / Client

* **Next.js (App Router):** React framework for the application.

* **React:** Frontend library.

* **Wagmi & Viem:** Hooks and utilities for reliable Ethereum interaction.

* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (LTS version) and **npm** or **yarn**.

2. **MetaMask or equivalent wallet** configured for the Sepolia Testnet.

3. **Eth wallet (Admin):** If you wish to use the admin functions, ensure your connected wallet address is set as the `OWNER_ADDRESS` placeholder in the frontend code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/kedar-singh/cryptostakei.git cd cryptostakei

### 2. Install Dependencies

npm install

### 3. Smart Contract Setup (Conceptual)

Assuming you have a Hardhat or similar directory structure:

1. **Compile the Contract:**

npm run dev

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Flow

### User Flow

1. **Connect Wallet:** Navigate to the site and connect your wallet (or you will be redirected to the "Please Connect Your Wallet" page).

2. **Check Price:** View the current ETH/USD price from the Chainlink Oracle.

3. **Place Bet:** Enter a USD amount (min. 5 USD equivalent) and select either "Bet Up (Higher)" or "Bet Down (Lower)".

4. **Confirm:** Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Admin Flow (Contract Owner)

1. **Access Admin:** If your connected address is the contract owner, a **Go to Admin** link appears on the main betting page.

2. **Start Pool:** Click **Start New Pool** to lock in the current ETH price (`BET`) and begin accepting bets.

3. **End Pool:** After a suitable period, click **End Current Pool**. This triggers the smart contract to:

   * Fetch the new ETH price.

   * Determine the winning side (Up or Down).

   * Calculate and distribute the winnings to successful players.

   * Reset the pool state.
